- set credentials after usernamepassword authentication
- rememberMeProvider - by a cookie
- groups?

how remember me works:


	user has a cookie: hash, series
        user is logged in by remember me token
        when logged in - give new hash
        when logged in via form  - give hash and series
        when logged out - delete remember me token from cookies and db
